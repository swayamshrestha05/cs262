/**
 * This module implements a REST-inspired web service for the Monopoly DB hosted
 * on PostgreSQL for Azure. Notes:
 *
 * - Currently, this service supports the Player table only.
 *
 * - This service is written in TypeScript and uses Node type-stripping, which
 * is experimental, but simple (see: https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively).
 * To do a static type check, run the following:
 *      npm run type-check
 *
 * - The service assumes that the database connection strings and the server
 * mode are set in environment variables (e.g., using a git-ignored `.env.sh` file).
 * See the DB_* variables used by pgPromise.
 *
 * - To execute locally, run the following:
 *      source .env.sh
 *      npm start
 *
 * - To guard against SQL injection attacks, this code uses pgPromise's built-in
 * variable escaping. This prevents a client from issuing this SQL-injection URL:
 *     `https://cs262.azurewebsites.net/players/1;DELETE FROM Player`
 * which would delete records in the PlayerGame and then the Player tables.
 * In particular, we don't use JS template strings because this doesn't filter
 * client-supplied values properly.
 *
 * - The endpoints call `next(err)` to handle errors without crashing the service.
 * This initiates the default error handling middleware, which logs full error
 * details to the server-side console and returns uninformative HTTP 500
 * responses to clients. This makes the service a bit more secure (because it
 * doesn't reveal database details to clients), but also makes it more difficult
 * for API users (because they don't get useful error messages).
